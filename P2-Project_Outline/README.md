# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is an online cookbook that users can search to find new recipes, or post their own. Anyone can browse the 
recipes by type (main course, appetizer, breakfast, etc.), specific name, prep time, or author, depending on what they
are looking for. Users will be able to create their own accounts and log in to post their own recipes for others to try.
This web app will make it easy to search for meal ideas, a recipe for a special occasion, or share your grandma's 
famous casserole.
### Features
User Login: users will be able to register for and sign into their own account.
Post Recipes: registered users will be able to post their recipes to be viewed on the main site.
Search: any user can search the recipe book by specific criteria, or browse a list in a given category.
Rate/Review: any user can rate a recipe they have tried (maybe leave a picture and comments as well..?).
### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot
ThymeLeaf
PhpMyAdmin
Javascript
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will definitely have to solidify my knowledge of building a program from the ground up. I will need to reinforce my 
knowledge in Java and SpringBoot. I would like to add some Javascript to make the front end more polished and 
user-friendly. I'd definitely like to have sharp looking recipe cards and user pages with pictures, video and sound.
